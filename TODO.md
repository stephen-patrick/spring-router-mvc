# TODO
* Consider adding support for a routes file that supplements the java configuration of the router using java file watcher.
* Create custom routes such as a REST Crud Route that creates the rest url mappings for read, update, create, delete etc.  The route manges the creation of the child routes.
* Add a Rest Link builder. 
* Maybe allow default parameters.
* Add Project to Maven repository, fix dependencies.
* Add Project to continuous integration build.
* Add support for other views, such as string template, velocity etc.
